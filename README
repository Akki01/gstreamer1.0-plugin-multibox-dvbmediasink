# gstreamer1.0-plugin-multibox-dvbmediasink
This git is based on pli4 git://git.code.sf.net/p/openpli/gst-plugin-dvbmediasink Branch gst-1.0
It adds support for more boxes then only the et stb's.
Boxes which currently should be ok are:
vuplus series, dm8000 and dm800se

An example off bb file is added.

This is the one I use in openpli with the modern openembedded-oe-core.
